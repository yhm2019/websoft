    <p>Q1:Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.</p>
    <p>A1:I didn't use node/npm before.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Q2: How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?</p>
    <p>A2: JavaScript is much more flexible than Java. For example, I can change the length of array after defining it. And it is easy to use Node to test simple code without writing the codes into a file and it can help you to check the code sentence by sentence so that you can find the bug immediately. Node involves some base APIs which are difficult for a new hand to use, but Express encapsulates them, so we can use it easier.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Q3: Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?</p>
    <p>A3: I finished the sample first</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Q4:What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?</p>
    <p>A4:Grade 4. It is difficult for me.</p>
    </br>
    <p>Q4: What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <p>A4: .</p>
