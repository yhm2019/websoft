    <p>Q1:Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?</p>
    <p>A1:No. I didn't learn JavaScript until this course.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Q2: Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?</p>
    <p>A2: JavaScript ia a script language and Java is a Object-Oriented language. In java, we should identify <code>int</code>, <code>string</code> or something else. But in JavaScript, we only use <code>var</code>, and the compiler will check the data type while runtime. The file extension of two languages are also differnt. JavaScript uses *.js, and Java uses *.class. What is more, JavaScript is much more flexible than Java. The length of array can't be changed after defining in Java, but it can be changed in JavaScript.</p>

    <p>Q3: Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?</p>
    <p>A3: Firstly, I followed the teacher to finish the basic tasks. Then, I look through some pages about JavaScript to find some useful information about other tasks and try my best to finish them. In the first stage, I only want to get the grade 3. I meet some problems on it which take me a lot time to finish the tasks of grade 3. After I finished grade 3, I try my best to get grade 4. But I failed in grade 5.</p>
    <br/>
