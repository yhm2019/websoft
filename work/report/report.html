<h2>S01</h2>
<p>Q1:Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</p>
    <p>A1:I known Git, GitHub and GitHub Pages. But I didn't know Markdown.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Q2: Have you ever created websites before?</p>
    <p>A2: Yes. But only create a simple website using CSS and HTML. I didn't learn Javascript until this course.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Q3: Briefly explain your experience.</p>
    <p>A3: I used HTML and CSS creating a simple website when I was a freshman. </p>
    <br/>
    <p>Q4: Briefly explain knowledge of web application development.</p>
    <p>Web application development creats application programs that use remote servers. And those applications are delivered to the user's computer, mobiles or else devices through the Internet.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Q5:What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <p>A5 : I used a Git GUI tool which called SourceTree to commit codes or something else before the course. But now I can use cmd.exe to take those actions. It is much more convenience. In addition, I know what Markdown is. It is a lightweight markup language with text formatting syntax.</p>

<h2>S02</h2>
<p>Q1:Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</p>
    <p>A1:Yes. I created a simple website using HTML and CSS when I was freshman. But I didn't learn Js untill this course.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Q2: Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</p>
    <p>A2: HTML works with the Structure and Framework. CSS works with Look and Format. JavaScript works with the Infrastructure.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Q3: Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.</p>
    <p>A3: At the beginning, the browser make connection to the web server using TCP protocol. Once connected, the browser will send a HTTP request, in form of a URL. The requests sends independently from each other(header and an empty line indicating the end of the header). The request is proccessesd by the server and a HTTPresponse is sent back to the browser.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Q4: What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <p>A4: I review relative knowledge about CSS, HTML and network(HTTP). In addition, I learn the syntax about the Javascript. Now I can use Javascript, CSS and HTML to create webs.</p>

<h2>S03</h2>
<p>Q1:Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?</p>
    <p>A1:No. I didn't learn JavaScript until this course.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Q2: Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?</p>
    <p>A2: JavaScript ia a script language and Java is a Object-Oriented language. In java, we should identify <code>int</code>, <code>string</code> or something else. But in JavaScript, we only use <code>var</code>, and the compiler will check the data type while runtime. The file extension of two languages are also differnt. JavaScript uses *.js, and Java uses *.class. What is more, JavaScript is much more flexible than Java. The length of array can't be changed after defining in Java, but it can be changed in JavaScript.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Q3: Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?</p>
    <p>A3: Firstly, I followed the teacher to finish the basic tasks. Then, I look through some pages about JavaScript to find some useful information about other tasks and try my best to finish them. In the first stage, I only want to get the grade 3. I meet some problems on it which take me a lot time to finish the tasks of grade 3. After I finished grade 3, I try my best to get grade 4. But I failed in grade 5.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Q4: What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <p>A4: After this class, I know how to use fetch(), and how to use JavaScript to make picture dynamic.</p>

<h2>S04</h2>
<p>Q1:Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.</p>
    <p>A1:I didn't use node/npm before.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Q2: How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?</p>
    <p>A2: JavaScript is much more flexible than Java. For example, I can change the length of array after defining it. And it is easy to use Node to test simple code without writing the codes into a file and it can help you to check the code sentence by sentence so that you can find the bug immediately. Node involves some base APIs which are difficult for a new hand to use, but Express encapsulates them, so we can use it easier.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Q3: Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?</p>
    <p>A3: I finished the example first to get the basic knowledge. Then I looked through the assignment and think what knowledge I need. Next, I went back to see examples and coding. It worked.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Q4:What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?</p>
    <p>A4:I hope to get grade 5. But actually, grade 4 is also difficult for me.</p>
    </br>
    <p>Q5: What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <p>A5: I learned about Node, Node Express and EJS. I can also organize codes in files and modules.</p>

<h2>S05</h2>
<p>Q1: How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?</p>
<p>A1: I think PHP is easier than Java. Because PHP has less concept.</p>
<p>Q2: Can you compare PP to other languages you know?</p>
<p>A2: 1. PHP has less concept than Java. </p>
<p>    2. PHP don't need to identify the type of variables, but java need.</p>
<p>    3. The suffix name of PHP file is <code>.php</code>, but in Java is <code>.class</code>.</p>
<p>    4. PHP uses <code>.</code> to connect string, but Java uses <code>+</code>.</p>
<p>    5. PHP has magic constants, like <code>__DIR__</code>, but Java don't have something like this.</p>
<p>Q3: Describe how you took on the coding exersice, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result.</p>
<p>A3: Before I coding, I watched the video. Then I looked the example codes and imitated them to coding. My goal is to get grade 5, but if I got it in final I won't be satisfied because I can find all methods in the example codes. </p>
<p>Q4: What is your TIL for course section?</p>
<p>A4: I know how to write codes using PHP. And I can rebuild webpages from HTML to PHP and connect pages to a mySQL database through PHP. What is more, I can use CRUD operations to the database using PHP and HTML forms.</p>

<h2>S06</h2>
<p>Q1: What is your own opinion on popularity of programming languages and what are your thoughts of future popularity among programming language?</p>
<p>A1 : I think now popular programming languages are JavaScript, Java, Python, C++， C, PHP, Shell, Kotlin, C#, .NET... In the future, JavaScript, Java, Python, C#, Kotlin and .NET can still be popular. But according some data about  the language which developers love and want to learn, I guess Rust and Go can also be popular in future.</p>
<p>Q2: What will be your own choice for selecting future programming languages?</p>
<P>A2: My choice is Python. Because the Python is easy to learn compare to other programming languages. And it can use less codes to write a n application or something else.</P>
<p>Q3: Do your own investigation on https://trends.google.com (Links to an external site.) to customize your own comparison on programming languages (or frameworks) and elaborate on the results.</p>
<p>A3: <img src="data.png" width="800px"></p>
<p>The picture above illustrates the result of compare Python to Java, PHP and JavaScript and we can find Python is a hot search word. The number of Python is always higher than Java, PHP and JavaScript. And we also find the number of Python, Java, PHP, Javascript are all rising from the end of 2019 to the beginning of 2020 but the number of Python rose most significantly. According to this, I think Python is more popular than Java, PHP and JavaScript in 2020.</p>
<p>Q4: If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your potential employer and your next large project, what would it be and how would you “sell it”?</p>
<p>A4: Python programming language develops quickly and the language is concise and it is easy to read and understand. Python is usually used in various fields and is a universal language. Whether it is websites, game development, robotics, AI, big data, cloud computing or some high-tech space shuttle controls, Python language can be used. Besides, it is not difficult for graphical programming using Python and Python offer various APIs and tools.</p>
<p>Q5: What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
<p>A5: I know some popular JavaScript and PHP frameworks. I also reviewed something about MVC.</p>
