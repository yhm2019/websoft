<p>Q1:Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</p>
    <p>A1:I known Git, GitHub and GitHub Pages. But I didn't know Markdown.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Q2: Have you ever created websites before?</p>
    <p>A2: Yes. But only create a simple website using CSS and HTML. I didn't learn Javascript until this course.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Q3: Briefly explain your experience.</p>
    <p>A3: I used HTML and CSS creating a simple website when I was a freshman. </p>
    <br/>
    <p>Q4: Briefly explain knowledge of web application development.</p>
    <p>Web application development creats application programs that use remote servers. And those applications are delivered to the user's computer, mobiles or else devices through the Internet.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Q5:What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <p>A5 : I used a Git GUI tool which called SourceTree to commit codes or something else before the course. But now I can use cmd.exe to take those actions. It is much more convenience. In addition, I know what Markdown is. It is a lightweight markup language with text formatting syntax.</p>

<h2>S02</h2>
<p>Q1:Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</p>
    <p>A1:Yes. I created a simple website using HTML and CSS when I was freshman. But I didn't learn Js untill this course.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Q2: Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</p>
    <p>A2: HTML works with the Structure and Framework. CSS works with Look and Format. JavaScript works with the Infrastructure.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Q3: Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.</p>
    <p>A3: At the beginning, the browser make connection to the web server using TCP protocol. Once connected, the browser will send a HTTP request, in form of a URL. The requests sends independently from each other(header and an empty line indicating the end of the header). The request is proccessesd by the server and a HTTPresponse is sent back to the browser.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Q4: What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <p>A4: I review relative knowledge about CSS, HTML and network(HTTP). In addition, I learn the syntax about the Javascript. Now I can use Javascript, CSS and HTML to create webs.</p>

<h2>S03</h2>
<p>Q1:Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?</p>
    <p>A1:No. I didn't learn JavaScript until this course.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Q2: Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?</p>
    <p>A2: JavaScript ia a script language and Java is a Object-Oriented language. In java, we should identify <code>int</code>, <code>string</code> or something else. But in JavaScript, we only use <code>var</code>, and the compiler will check the data type while runtime. The file extension of two languages are also differnt. JavaScript uses *.js, and Java uses *.class. What is more, JavaScript is much more flexible than Java. The length of array can't be changed after defining in Java, but it can be changed in JavaScript.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Q3: Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?</p>
    <p>A3: Firstly, I followed the teacher to finish the basic tasks. Then, I look through some pages about JavaScript to find some useful information about other tasks and try my best to finish them. In the first stage, I only want to get the grade 3. I meet some problems on it which take me a lot time to finish the tasks of grade 3. After I finished grade 3, I try my best to get grade 4. But I failed in grade 5.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Q4: What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <p>A4: After this class, I know how to use fetch(), and how to use JavaScript to make picture dynamic.</p>

<h2>S04</h2>
<p>Q1:Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.</p>
    <p>A1:I didn't use node/npm before.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Q2: How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?</p>
    <p>A2: JavaScript is much more flexible than Java. For example, I can change the length of array after defining it. And it is easy to use Node to test simple code without writing the codes into a file and it can help you to check the code sentence by sentence so that you can find the bug immediately. Node involves some base APIs which are difficult for a new hand to use, but Express encapsulates them, so we can use it easier.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Q3: Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?</p>
    <p>A3: I finished the example first to get the basic knowledge. Then I looked through the assignment and think what knowledge I need. Next, I went back to see examples and coding. It worked.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Q4:What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?</p>
    <p>A4:I hope to get grade 5. But actually, grade 4 is also difficult for me.</p>
    </br>
    <p>Q5: What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <p>A5: I learned about Node, Node Express and EJS. I can also organize codes in files and modules.</p>
